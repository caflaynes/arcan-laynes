Here are the things that I want for each pages each unfollowed instructions results to minus points.

Home Page

- Picture of you (it can be a any as long as it resembles you)

- Name

- one line that describes you

- social media links (Linkedin & Github)

Projects Page

- All of the projects you've done so far it can be any from your programming class, or any things you created during your student life.

Contact Page

- Place a form with Name (text), Email (text), and Message (textarea) and a Submit button

- It should have a text that instructs us what to do in the Form.

- Forms are not taught so you need to self learn there are many tools in W3schools or any site. (That's the challenge, I want to see how you adapt.)



Submissions

- Picture of the pages and compressed them in PDF file.

   -- The pages should have a name on what page is it.

   -- Filename <Family Name>_PORTFOLIO_SCREENSHOTS.pdf

- All html and css file

   -- Don't zip it just directly upload it for easy checking

   -- Ideally I should see 3 html files, 1 css file. But if you use tailwind I'll accept 3 html files :D
